# LegoCV

Fully functional OpenCV wrapper for Objective-C and Swift to eliminate the need to use Objective-C++ and allow full compatibility with Swift projects.

# Mission

Swift is one of the fastest evolving languages, but cannot use C++ frameworks directly, as it could be with Objective-C/C++.

# License

BSD license, respect OpenCV license as well.
