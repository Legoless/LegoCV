# LegoCV

Fully functional OpenCV wrapper for Objective-C and Swift to eliminate the need to use Objective-C++ and allow full compatibility with Swift projects.

# Mission

Swift is one of the fastest evolving languages, but there is no way to use C++ frameworks directly, as it could be with Objective-C/C++.

The idea is simply wrap OpenCV classes into Objective-C native classes, which are then bridged to Swift, similar as [Realm]()  and [EmguCV]() in C#.

# Examples

Swift (LegoCV):
```swift
```

Objective-C (LegoCV with Objective-C):
```objectivec
```

C++ (original OpenCV):
```cpp
```

# Installation

LegoCV can be installed with CocoaPods or Carthage.

# License

BSD license, respect [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) license as well.
