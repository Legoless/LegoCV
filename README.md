# LegoCV

Fully functional OpenCV wrapper for Objective-C and Swift to eliminate the need to use Objective-C++ and allow full compatibility with Swift projects.

# Mission

Swift is one of the fastest evolving languages, but there is no way to use C++ frameworks directly, as it could be with Objective-C/C++.

The idea is simply wrap OpenCV classes into Objective-C native classes, which are then bridged to Swift, similar as [Realm]()  and [EmguCV]() in C#.

# Example

The following examples display the difference in using LegoCV in Swift and Objective-C versus vanilla OpenCV in C++.
The example is extracted from Face detection sample code, shipped with LegoCV.

Swift (LegoCV):
```swift
```

Objective-C (LegoCV with Objective-C):
```objectivec
```

C++ (OpenCV):
```cpp
```
